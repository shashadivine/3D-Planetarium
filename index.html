Venus is a fascinating yet inhospitable world.</p> <p> <b>Temperatures:</b> Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, with surface temperatures reaching around 465Â°C due to its runaway greenhouse effect. </p> <p> <b>Surface Conditions:</b> The surface of Venus is marked by extensive plains, highland regions, and numerous volcanoes. </p> <p> <b>Orbital Period:</b> Venus takes about 225 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun. A day on Venus lasts about 243 Earth days. </p> <p> <b>Atmosphere:</b> Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, making the environment highly corrosive and opaque. </p> <p> <b>Moons:</b> Venus does not have any moons or natural satellites. </p> </div> </div> </section> <div class="space"></div> <section> <div class="card planet-right"> <div class="card-body"> <p class="card-title">EARTH</p> <p class="card-text">Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is our home and the only known planet to support life. Its diverse ecosystems and favorable conditions make it unique in our solar system.</p> <p> <b>Surface Conditions:</b> Earth's surface is about 71% water, with the remaining 29% consisting of continents and islands. This mix of land and water supports a wide variety of life forms. </p> <p> <b>Orbital Period:</b> Earth takes about 365.25 days to complete one orbit around the Sun, giving us our year. This extra quarter day is why we have a leap year every four years. </p> <p> <b>Atmosphere:</b> Earth has a rich atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with traces of other gases such as argon and carbon dioxide. This atmosphere protects life by filtering out harmful solar radiation and helping regulate temperature. </p> <p> <b>Moons:</b> Earth has one natural satellite, the Moon (our moon), which affects tides and stabilizes the planet's axial tilt. The Moon's gravitational influence plays a crucial role in the behavior of our oceans. </p> </div> </div> </section> <div class="space"></div> <section> <div class="card ml-3 planet-left"> <div class="card-body"> <p class="card-title">MARS</p> <p class="card-text">Meet Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun. It has been a major focus of exploration due to its potential for past or present life and future human colonization.</p> <p> <b>Surface Conditions:</b> Mars has a cold, desert-like environment with surface temperatures ranging from -125Â°C in winter to 20Â°C in summer. Mars features the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, which stands about 22 kilometers high. </p> <p> <b>Orbital Period:</b> Mars takes about 687 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun, making its year nearly twice as long as Earth's. A day on Mars is approximately 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds in Earth time. </p> <p> <b>Atmosphere:</b> The Martian atmosphere is composed mostly of carbon dioxide (95%), with traces of nitrogen and argon. It is about 100 times thinner than Earth's atmosphere, providing little protection from solar radiation and contributing to the planet's extreme temperatures. </p> <p> <b>Moons:</b> Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos. </p> </div> </div> </section> <div class="space"></div> <section> <div class="card planet-right"> <div class="card-body"> <p class="card-title">JUPITER</p> <p class="card-text">Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is the largest planet in our solar system. Known for its striking bands and Great Red Spot, Jupiter is a gas giant with a fascinating composition and many moons.</p> <p> <b>Rings:</b> While not as prominent as Saturn's, Jupiter has a faint ring system composed of dust particles ejected from its moons due to meteoroid impacts. </p> <p> <b>Orbital Period:</b> Jupiter takes about 12 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. However, day on Jupiter lasts 10 hours. </p> <p> <b>Atmosphere:</b> Jupiter's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen (about 90%) and helium (about 10%), with trace amounts of other gases like methane, water vapor, and ammonia. </p> <p> <b>Moons:</b> Jupiter has 79 known moons, the four largest of which are the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. </p> </div> </div> </section> <div class="space"></div> <section> <div class="card ml-3 planet-left"> <div class="card-body"> <p class="card-title">SATURN</p> <p class="card-text">Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, is renowned for its spectacular ring system. As a gas giant, Saturn shares similarities with Jupiter but has its own unique features and a large collection of moons.</p> <p> <b>Rings:</b> Saturn's rings are the most extensive and complex in the solar system. Composed mainly of ice particles with some rock and dust, the rings vary in size from tiny grains to objects as large as mountains. The rings are divided into several groups, labeled alphabetically in the order they were discovered. </p> <p> <b>Orbital Period:</b> Saturn takes about 29.5 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. A day on Saturn is about 10.7 hours. </p> <p> <b>Atmosphere:</b> Saturn's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen (about 96%) and helium (about 3%), with traces of methane, ammonia, and other gases. </p> <p> <b>Moons:</b> Saturn has 83 confirmed moons, with Titan being the largest and one of the most intriguing.

There are 13 known rings, with the inner rings being narrow and dark and the outer rings being brightly colored. </p> <p> <b>Tilt:</b> Uranus has an axial tilt of about 98 degrees, meaning it essentially rolls around the Sun on its side. This unique tilt results in unusual seasonal variations and extreme weather patterns. </p> <p> <b>Orbital Period:</b> Uranus takes about 84 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. A day on Uranus is about 17 hours and 14 minutes. </p> <p> <b>Atmosphere:</b> Uranus's atmosphere is composed mostly of hydrogen (about 83%), helium (about 15%), and methane (about 2%). The methane gives the planet its blue-green color by absorbing red light and reflecting blue light. </p> <p> <b>Moons:</b> Uranus has 27 known moons, the largest moons are Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda. These moons have a variety of terrains, including large canyons, valleys, and craters. </p> </div> </div> </section> <div class="space"></div> <section> <div class="card ml-3 planet-left"> <div class="card-body"> <p class="card-title">NEPTUNE</p> <p class="card-text">Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is a gas giant similar in composition to Uranus due to its composition.</p> <p> <b>Tilt:</b> Uranus has an axial tilt of about 28.32 degrees relative to its orbital plane around the Sun. This tilt contributes to the planet's dynamic weather patterns and atmospheric phenomena </p> <p> <b>Orbital Period:</b> Neptune takes about 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. A day on Neptune is about 16 hours and 6 minutes. Like Uranus, Neptune experiences extreme seasonal variations due to its axial tilt. </p> <p> <b>Atmosphere:</b> Neptune's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 80%) and helium (about 19%), with trace amounts of methane (about 1%). The presence of methane in its upper atmosphere gives Neptune its blue color, giving its label as the "Ice Giant". </p> <p> <b>Moons:</b> Neptune has 14 known moons, the largest of which is Triton. Triton is unique among the moons of the Solar System because it orbits Neptune in a retrograde direction, opposite to the planet's rotation. </p> </div> </div> </section> <div class="space"></div> </header></main> <script type="module" src="./index.3cff2ed3.js"></script> </body></html>
