# ABOUT
Welcome to the 3D Planetarium, my first Three.js project that reflects my passion for technology, art, and science.

Developing this planetarium was a learning experience, allowing me to experiment with 3D artistry while honing my web development skills. Each planet, which I meticulously crafted, showcases my journey as both a developer and an artist.

With a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, these planets are brought to life, mirroring their real-world behavior. From rotational orientation to speed, each planet behaves as it would in space, ordered relative to the Sun.
